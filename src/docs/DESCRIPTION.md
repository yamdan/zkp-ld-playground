# Description of ZKP-LD Playground

## Overview

ZKP-LD Playground is a web-based demonstration application for experimenting with Linked Data-based Verifiable Credentials (VCs) that support selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs.
It allows you to issue VCs, selectively disclose attributes when presenting them, and verify the presented VCs with predicate proofs.

This application has many features below:

- Generate Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
- Present a Verifiable Presentation (VP) from multiple VCs
- Selective disclosure
- Secret Holder Binding for VC
- Predicate Proof
  - Range Proof for Integer
  - Range Proof for Datetime
